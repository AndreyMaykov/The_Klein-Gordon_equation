# The Klein-Gordon equation
In this project, a code for numerical solving the initial-boundary problem
![ ](https://github.com/AndreiMaikov/The_Klein-Gordon_equation/blob/main/images/Formulas_3_25.png)
was developed. 

This problem is related to the Klein-Gordon equation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis) and important for testing the so-called open boundary conditions for equations that describe electromagnetic or acoustic waves in various media.

The code implements a family of explicit and implicit finite difference methods (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_method). For the latter, an iterative algorithm was utilized to obtain the numeric solution.
